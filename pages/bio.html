<h1>About Me</h1>
I am a Ph.D. student in <a href="http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/big/index.html"><i class="fas fa-laptop-medical"></i> Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG)</a> in the Department of Biomedical Informatics of Harvard Medical School.

I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a B.S. in bioengineering in 2015. Before returning to school, I worked as an ORISE research fellow at the Food and Drug Administration and as a research specialist in the <a href="http://labs.pathology.jhu.edu/larman/"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-flask" aria-hidden="true"></i> H. Benjamin Larman  Lab</a> of the  Department of Pathology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. In the Larman Lab, I performed high-throughput, massively-multiplexed immune profiling assays and designed software for related data analyses.
