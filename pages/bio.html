<h1>About Me</h1>

I am a Ph.D. student in <a href="http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/big/index.html"><i class="fas fa-laptop-medical"></i> Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG)</a> in the Department of Biomedical Informatics of Harvard Medical School. As a member of the <a href="https://elledge.hms.harvard.edu/"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-flask" aria-hidden="true"></i> Stephen Elledge Lab</a>, I study the human immune response with high-throughput, massively-multiplexed assays. I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a B.S. in bioengineering in 2015. Before returning to school, I worked as an ORISE research fellow at the Food and Drug Administration and as a research specialist in the <a href="http://labs.pathology.jhu.edu/larman/"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-flask" aria-hidden="true"></i> H. Benjamin Larman  Lab</a> at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
